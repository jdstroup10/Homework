# Homework 1 for UT Boot Camp (Marketing SEO Refactor)
>Refactoring a marketing page to make it SEO friendly 

-  This was a homework assignment where we refactored a premade website in order to make it more accessable to users.

## Notes:
HTML: In the HTML file the primary changes I made to the code involved adding alts to the href and img elements. The purpose of alts is to make the website more accessible to users in the event the images do not load for them. I also added a title text to the main background image that will appear when the user hovers their mouse over the image. Also, I removed a few of the <div> elements and replaced them with <nav> and <section> to make the sections more specific.
  
CSS: In the CSS file I was able group many classes together that shared the same css properties such as color and margin. Grouping the classes enabled me to comment out a lot of the code and make it look a lot cleaner. I was also able to remove a piece of code that only had list-style-type as none. Since the default is already "none", I was ble to comment this code out.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
